Phase A – Setup

@context → all units, enums, object properties.

Ship → top-level entity (with hasSystem pointing to HullStructureSystem and PropulsionSystem).

Phase B – Hull
3. HullStructureSystem (Deck, Bulkhead, Sides, Bow, Stern, Ice belt zones).

Phase C – Propulsion Core
4. PropulsionSystem skeleton (just structure, no details yet).
5. PrimeMover (Engine, with FuelSystem, CoolingSystem, StartingSystem, etc.).
6. TransmissionSystem (Gearbox, Coupling).
7. ShaftingSystem (Intermediate shafts, bearings, seals, stern tube, brakes, dampers).

Phase D – Propulsors
8. PropulsorSystem (Propeller, Nozzle, CP Hub).
9. ThrusterSystem (Azimuthing thruster, ridge loads, vibration checks).
10. RudderAndSteeringSystem.

Phase E – Cross-cutting
11. ControlAndMonitoringSystem.
12. MaterialsRequirements.
13. ConstraintIntents (natural-language anchors for SHACL).

Minor notes (not blockers)

Your revPerSec alias currently points to "unit:HZ". That’s fine syntactically, but semantically Hz = 1/s (frequency), not always “rev/s”. If you want stricter QUDT alignment, you could point it to unit:REV-PER-SEC.

For fatigue you may later want explicit rho / gamma factors (γ_ε1, γ_ε2, etc.) as separate terms, but those can be added in Phase D/E.
