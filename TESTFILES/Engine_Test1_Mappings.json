  {
    "original": "P_W",
    "best_match": "mcrPower_kW",
    "confidence": 0.46,
    "reason": "Variable 'P_W' likely stands for 'Power' in kilowatts, matching both the meaning and unit of 'mcrPower_kW' (MCR power [kW]) in the PrimeMover domain. Other candidates do not match as closely in meaning or unit."
  },
  {
    "original": "omega_ME",
    "best_match": "nn_rpm",
    "confidence": 0.5,
    "reason": "The variable 'omega_ME' represents engine speed in revolutions per minute (RPM), matching the unit and meaning of 'nn_rpm', which is nominal speed at MCR in RPM. Although the domain is Propeller, none of the candidates have PrimeMover with RPM; thus, 'nn_rpm' is the closest match for speed in RPM."
  },
  {
    "original": "T_ME",
    "best_match": "qEmax_kNm",
    "confidence": 0.85,
    "reason": "T_ME likely stands for 'Torque Mechanical Engine'; qEmax_kNm represents 'Prime mover maximum torque' in kNm, matching both the unit and the engine context."
  },
  {
    "original": "T_bollard",
    "best_match": "Tr_kN",
    "confidence": 0.45,
    "reason": "T_bollard likely refers to thrust at bollard pull, measured in kiloNewtons. 'Tr_kN' represents design response thrust in kN, which matches the unit and likely meaning. Other candidates are less relevant in unit or concept."

  {
    "original": "SeaChestVol_m3",
    "best_match": "seaChestVolume_m3",
    "confidence": 0.66,
    "reason": "The variable name, unit (m3), and context all indicate it refers to the volume of the sea chest, which matches the ontology property 'seaChestVolume_m3' describing the volume of a CoolingWaterInletChest."
  },
  {
    "original": "Y_strength",
    "best_match": "yieldStrength_MPa",
    "confidence": 0.59,
    "reason": "The abbreviation 'Y' in 'Y_strength' most likely refers to 'Yield', and the unit MPa matches the candidate 'yieldStrength_MPa'. The domain MechanicalPropertySet is appropriate for a material property like yield strength."
