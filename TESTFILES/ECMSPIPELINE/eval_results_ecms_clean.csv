However, 'addedMass_kg' specifically refers to hydrodynamic added mass, which may not be a perfect conceptual match if 'mass_Kg' refers to total or static mass. The next closest candidate, 'mass', has a slightly lower similarity score (0.48) and is scoped to ElectricMotor, which may not align with the OEM context. Therefore, 'addedMass_kg' is selected as the best available match, but the mapping confidence is moderate due to possible differences in the intended meaning of 'mass'.",HUMAN_REVIEW
paper_sampo.ttl,power_P,output_power,0.5,"The OEM variable 'power_P' most likely refers to active or real power, typically denoted as 'P' in electrical engineering.
