    "original": "Engine_Power",
    "best_match": "mcrPower_kW",
    "confidence": 0.54,
    "reason": "The variable 'Engine_Power' with unit kW and context of an engine test most closely matches 'mcrPower_kW', which represents the maximum continuous rating (MCR) power of a prime mover in kilowatts. The other candidates refer to torque or mechanical factors, which are not direct representations of engine power."
